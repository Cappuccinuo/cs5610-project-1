\begin{abstract}  % put your abstract here!
Pacman Capture the Flag is a variant of a popular game called Ms.Pacman.
This paper details the approaches taken to design agents to play this multi-player game.
The goal of the team is to get as much food as possible on the opponent's 
territory and bring the food back within limited time and steps, while defending food on their own territory.
The uncertainty of opponent's policy and location is the challenge of the game.
We designed two teams PacmanGo and GoTeam. PacmanGo is composed of one offensive
agent based on Minimax, and one defensive agent which uses particle filter to approximate
opponent's locations.  GoTeam is composed of two feature-based offensive agents, which will
collaborate while attacking.  
Our teams can perform well when competing with other teams with average winning rate of 56.25\%.

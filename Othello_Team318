    Rules:
    - Black chess will move first. 
    - A player must place a disc of his colour on one of the empty squares of 
    the board, adjacent to an opponent's disc. 
    - According to the rule of Othello, players take turns placing discs on the 
    board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any discs of the 
    opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disc just 
    placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the 
    current player's color 
    (Attribution goes to wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi). 
    - If one user doesn't have a legal move, he/she lost his/her turn, and it 
    becomes opponent's turn to move. 
    For Player:
    - They can exit the room or reset the game
    - They can move on the board
    For Observer:
    - They can exit the room


How a player can win:
The winner is the player who has more discs of his colour than his opponent at 
the end of the game. This will happen when neither of the two players has a 
legal move. Generally at this stage all 64 squares are occupied. However, 
it is possible that some empty squares will remain where neither player may 
move.
